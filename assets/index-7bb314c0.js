But before we dive into all that, let me share a bit of advice with you.
        Firstly, keep an open mind. You're going to meet a lot of interesting characters today, each with their own stories and insights about our company. They represent the diversity and the spirit of Bedrock. Engage with them, ask questions, and, most importantly, enjoy the process.
        Secondly, don’t rush. While it might be tempting to breeze through all the checkpoints, the real value comes from understanding the essence of what makes Bedrock unique. The content you’ll discover has been carefully chosen to give you a well-rounded view of our company.
        Lastly, don’t hesitate to revisit any part of the onboarding experience if you feel like you missed something. Our goal is for you to feel confident and informed about your new role here at Bedrock.
        Now, if you’re ready, let’s get started. Your first checkpoint is just ahead. Oh, and one more thing - keep an eye out for me!
