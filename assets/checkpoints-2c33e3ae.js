        Lastly, don’t hesitate to revisit any part of the onboarding experience if you feel like you missed something. Our goal is for you to feel confident and informed about your new role here at Bedrock.
        Now, if you’re ready, let’s get started. Your first checkpoint is just ahead. Oh, and one more thing - keep an eye out for me!
